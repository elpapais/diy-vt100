FAQ:

Q: why my terminal showing double content in single enter?
A: try disabling NEW LINE mode (setup B).

how to use!
since its a clone of vt100
everything is same(except hardware limitation),
so, you got to know how to use vt100 or 
see http://www.vt100.net/docs/vt100-ug/chapter1.html

NOTE: use F5 to load setup
since vt100 had only four Function keys (laymans language)
so i are reusing ps2 keyboard F5 for setup loading.
future version will likely to have dedicated keys for setup.
